## <span class="orange black-shadow">TL;DR;</span>
#### Intructions...

---
## <span class="orange black-shadow">Kardashev Scale</span>
This was proposed by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964. The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement.

---
## <span class="orange black-shadow">Type I</span>
> "Planetary Civilization" Can use and store all of the energy which reaches its planet from its parent star.

---
## <span class="orange black-shadow">Type II</span>
> "Stellar Civilization" Can harness the total energy of its planet's parent star.

---
## <span class="orange black-shadow">Type III</span>
> "Galactic Civilization" Can control energy on the scale of its entire host galaxy.

---
## <span class="orange black-shadow">As of Today</span>
We scored a 0.72, we are not even a <strong>Type I</strong> yet. It is predicted that in the next 100-200 years we will acheive this.

## <span class="orange black-shadow">The World</span>

Note:
We all want the world. We want to hold it in our hands, we want claim it as our own. We all has a sense of perpetuity whether in Code, Contributions or Projects. We want to feel like what we do matters.

## <span class="orange black-shadow">Know Thyself</span>

Note:
I believe that you can never know anyone else without first knowing yourself. Think back to when you were a teenager, you thought you knew how people were. But you didn't, because you didn't first know who you were -- you were still figuring out who you were going to be.

## <span class="black-shadow">Fast Lane</span>

Note:
Life comes at you fast, and it all seems like a blur. It is our responsibility to have the foresight to what is coming ahead of us. Have you ever driven in the fast lane, only to be slowed down by another driver who is going 45 mph?

---?image=assets/accident.jpeg&size=contain
## <span class="orange black-shadow">Distractions</span>

Note:
Blake lights, all the cars are stopped -- traffic comes to a hault. But you later realize that everyone was looking at an accident on the other side of the freeway! WTF

---?image=assets/rainy-day.jpeg&size=contain
## <span class="orange black-shadow">Trapped</span>

Note:
Do you ever feel trapped or stuck...whether on a problem, or a project or even your career? Are they road blocks in your life that you have yet to go around?

---?image=assets/wet-road.jpeg&size=contain
## <span class="orange black-shadow">Realization</span>

Note:
It's wet and yucky...right. No, it smells amazing after it rains. It is cool and beautiful. Be positive!!
