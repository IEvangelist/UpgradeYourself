## <span class="orange black-shadow">The World</span>

Note:
We all want the world. We want to hold it in our hands, we want claim it as our own. We all has a sense of perpetuity whether in Code, Contributions or Projects. We want to feel like what we do matters.

## <span class="orange black-shadow">Know Thyself</span>

Note:
I believe that you can never know anyone else without first knowing yourself. Think back to when you were a teenager, you thought you knew how people were. But you didn't, because you didn't first know who you were -- you were still figuring out who you were going to be.

## <span class="black-shadow">Fast Lane</span>

Note:
Life comes at you fast, and it all seems like a blur. It is our responsibility to have the foresight to what is coming ahead of us. Have you ever driven in the fast lane, only to be slowed down by another driver who is going 45 mph?

Note:
Blake lights, all the cars are stopped -- traffic comes to a hault. But you later realize that everyone was looking at an accident on the other side of the freeway! WTF

## <span class="orange black-shadow">Trapped</span>

Note:
Do you ever feel trapped or stuck...whether on a problem, or a project or even your career? Are they road blocks in your life that you have yet to go around?

It's wet and yucky...right. No, it smells amazing after it rains. It is cool and beautiful. Be positive!!
